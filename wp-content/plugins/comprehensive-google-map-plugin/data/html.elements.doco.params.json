If latitude/longitude was provided as a marker location, the bubble content will contain the marker's latitude/longitude. Please note when entering geographical address - the geo addresses are validated by Google. If Google finds one or more geo addresses invalid (undetectable or unrecognizeable) you will be presented with an error dialog.<br /><br />You can also select a custom icon for your marker. If none is selected, default Google marker icon is used - the red pin with black dot. Please note that markers do not support animation at the moment. Thats not all, you can also provide a custom text for your marker! The custom description will be added to info bubble in addition to the address (or lat/long) information. When entering custom marker text, <b>no HTML tags are accepted</b>, in other words - all HTML tags will be stripped. Although no HTML allowed, you can still insert hyper links.<br /><br />Hyper links:<br /><code>#Fully qualified URL starting with http(s) followed by space and a link Name#</code>.<br /><br />Please note the opening and closing hash tags, they must be present.

Zoom levels vary depending on where in the world you are looking, as data in some parts of the globe is more defined than in others. Zoom levels up to 20 are possible within satellite view.
